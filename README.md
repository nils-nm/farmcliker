# Time Farm Cliker

This game is about how in the future the earth was captured by a mad AI and
only a small group of people remained on earth who are still fighting. With
the help of the Moshina of Time, food is sent to them from the past, thanks to
which they can still be spoiled. You need to click on the beds and collect
points after which you can destroy the robot on the right side of the screen
but each click on the robot increases the cost of destruction
